# What is adversery CTF
Adversary CTF was run by a company called crowdstrike, which is for pentesting. 
Adversery had 3 major challenges, which I only completed a small section of the 
challenge "Catapult Spider"

- SUCH EMAIL shibegoodboi@protonmail.com  

# What Steps I Took

1. I ran down in sherlock the username: Shibegoodboi
2. Lead to a reddit link called: https://www.reddit.com/user/shibegoodboi
3. Lead to twitter handle: https://twitter.com/shibegoodboi/with_replies
4. Lead to github: /shibefan
5. Lead to git pages website giving flag. 

# What I found hard. 
OK. So, the reason why I found this hard was because I thought this was a crypto question than an OSINT question. I spent more time looking at the HASHkeys given on websites and trying to find messages from the keys given to make a big flag. 

When I realised it wasn't a crypto question, I decided to reverse the email by going through leaksourced.ru, but I got nothing.
